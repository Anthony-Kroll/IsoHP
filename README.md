# Isotope-based Hydrologic Partitioning Model (IsoHP)
## What is IsoPH?
This is a code based version of the process used by UC-HAL hydrologists in order to better understand natural flows in the St.Mary/Milk River Basin (SMM) using unique isotopic signatures, including loses to evaporastranspiration and groundwater contribution. In this specific study, it was also used to determine the impact of the North Milk diversion channel on 



General code made to perform a water mass balance for a target basin, using Water Survey Canada hydrometric gauge data,  inflow and outflow isotope data, and the isoP model developed by UC-HAL to estimate the isotopic composition of precipitation.
