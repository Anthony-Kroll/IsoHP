# Isotope-based Hydrologic Partitioning Model (IsoHP)
General code made to perform a water mass balance for a target basin, using Water Survey Canada hydrometric gauge data,  inflow and outflow isotope data, and the isoP model developed by UC-HAL to estimate the isotopic composition of precipitation.
